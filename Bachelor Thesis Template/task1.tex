\section{Introduction}

For the first task we have found the documentation for writing a bachelor thesis on Moodle. Some PowerPoint slides are available from the previous semester introducing the requirements of the bachelor thesis\cite{bachelor} alongside with the curriculum for the BPA in Software Development.\cite{studieordning} Below we will describe our findings.

\section{The formalities}
The student must write a problem statement preferably in collaboration with a private or public company. The problem statement and project must be relevant for the education and the company. 

The maximum size of the bachelor project is 40 normal pages 
(2400 characters pr. page) pr. report +20 normal pages pr. student, i.e.:

\begin{itemize}
\item One student can hand-in up to 60 pages
\item Two students can hand-in up to 80 pages, etc
\end{itemize}

\noindent There is no absolute minimum, but teachers and
examiners experience it to be short if it is shorter
than 2/3 of the maximum.
\\
It can be written by groups as well as individual
students. 

\section{Essence of the bachelor thesis}
In the bachelor project, the student must document the ability to process on an analytical and methodological basis a complex and practical problem statement in relation to a specific task within the IT area.

\section{Learning objectives}
The final bachelor project must document that the graduation level of the education has been achieved.

\subsection{Knowledge}
The graduate has knowledge of:

\begin{itemize}
\item the strategic role of testing in system development
\item globalization of software production
\item system architecture and understanding of its strategic significance for the business of the company
\item applied theory and method together with comprehensive technologies within the domain
\item connections between applied theory, method and technology and can reflect on their suitability in different situations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skills}
The graduate can:

\begin{itemize}
    \item handle the planning and implementation of tests of major IT systems
    \item enter into professional collaboration on the development of large systems using comprehensive methods and technologies
    \item familiarize themselves with new technologies and standards for managing integration between systems
    \item through practice develop a competence profile from primarily being a backend developer to handle tasks as a system architect
    \item deal with the definition and realization of a business-wise and technologically appropriate architecture for large systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Competences}
The graduate can:

\begin{itemize}
    \item handle the planning and implementation of tests of major IT systems
    \item enter into professional collaboration on the development of large systems using comprehensive methods and technologies
    \item familiarize themselves with new technologies and standards for managing integration between systems
    \item through practice develop a competence profile from primarily being a backend developer to handle tasks as a system architect
    \item deal with the definition and realization of a business-wise and technologically appropriate architecture for large systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Relation to Internship}
It is recommended your bachelor project builds
on the experiences and the product of your
company work.
Often the internship report contains descriptions
of the company and the work you did. You can
reuse those parts if you state it clearly in the
bachelor report. 

\section{Content}
The bachelor report must focus on one or more of
the mandatory courses of the program:
\begin{itemize}
\item System Integration
\item Test
\item Databases for Developers
\item Large Systems Development\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent The bachelor project is typically centred on the
development of a product, the product being a
final developed and deployed product, a part of
such, or a prototype\\

\noindent The bachelor report should contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item A thorough description of the work done
\item A thorough evaluation and reflection of that work
\end{itemize}
